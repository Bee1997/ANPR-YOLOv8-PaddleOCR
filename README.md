# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) with YOLOv8 and PaddleOCR

This project implements Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using the YOLOv8 object detection model for vehicle detection and PaddleOCR for optical character recognition (OCR) of license plates. The application detects vehicles, recognizes license plates, and logs them to a CSV file.

## Project Structure

- **`run.py`**: Main script that loads the YOLOv8 and PaddleOCR models, processes the video frame-by-frame, and annotates detected license plates.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required packages to set up the environment.
- **`demoVideo.mp4`**: Sample video file used for vehicle and license plate detection.
- **`Car-List.csv`**: Output file that logs detected car IDs and corresponding license plate numbers.

## How It Works

1. **Vehicle Detection**: YOLOv8 detects vehicles in the video frames.
2. **License Plate OCR**: PaddleOCR recognizes and extracts license plate numbers from detected vehicles.
3. **CSV Logging**: Each unique vehicleâ€™s license plate number is saved to `Car-List.csv`.
4. **Annotated Video**: A video (`demoVideo_out.mp4`) is generated with annotated bounding boxes and recognized license plate numbers.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation
Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

###Run the Program

```bash
python run.py
```

##Example

Below are some example visualizations generated by running run.py:

- **Annotated video of detected vehicles**:
![Annotated video](demoVideo_out.mp4)

- **CSV output of recognized license plates.**:
![CSV output](Car-List.csv)

##Future Enhancements

- Improve OCR accuracy for license plates in challenging environments.
- Extend the tracking to handle multiple vehicles with overlapping paths.
- Integrate real-time camera feeds instead of processing static video files.
